There are 3 demonstration applications along w/a library you can easily include within your own projects.  I wrote BackProp1 in the late 1990's for a signal processing application and used it again a few years later as a image classifier.  BackProp1 is also available on [sourceforge](http://backprop1.sourceforge.net).\r\n\r\n* demo1 is a point classifier.  GenerateDatum.java creates a training set which classifies points as above or below the line y=-5x+2, while Trainer.java performs attempts to train NN.  Tester.java generates random (x,y) points to test the network.  The output from Tester can be fed to [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) for a nice graph.\r\n\r\n* demo2 is standard XOR problem, use Trainer.java to create network and Tester.java to validate\r\n\r\n* demo3 performs character recognition of the digits 0-9 represented in a 5x5 matrix.  Use GenerateDatum.java to create training files, then Trainer.java to train NN.  Demo3 comes w/a nice UI to illustrate training and NN resilience to noise.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}
